Python implementation of the ancient boardgame "Royal Game of Ur" with TKinter

## Introduction

The Royal Game of Ur is one of the oldest board games known to archaeology. Well-conserved remains of boards, along with a description of the game rules have been found in the 1920s in Mesopotamia. Its history can be traced back up to 5000 years ago, and has been played for a large amount of this time. Variations of this game have been known and played in other ancient civilizations, such as the Egyptians and Romans.

My personal interest in the game was sparked by a video of the curator of the British Museum, Irving Finkel, explaining the concepts and discovery of the game. Since the game has relatively simple rules and setup, I found it a fitting difficulty to try my hands on object-oriented programming and GUI implementation in Python.

## Rules

The rules for the Royal Game of Ur are fairly straight-forward. Variations exist, but in this program only one ruleset so far is implemented: the British Museum ruleset.

The game board consists of 20 colored squares, arranged three horizontal rows. Each player initially has 7 stones in his color (black or white).

Players take turns throwing marked tetrahedrons (equivalent to throwing dice with changed probability distribution). The possible outcomes are 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, where 2 is the most probable. Each player moves any stone the designated number of fields along a certain path with the goal of reaching the end and "freeing" the stone. The game ends when one player has managed to get all his 7 stones out of the game before the other player.

A complication is added by two additional rules:
1. The players can kick each other back to the start. For this a stone must hop to a field where a stone of another player is already sitting.
2. The players can throw the dice again, if they land on a red square ("rosette") with their previous move. The red squares are spaced 4 fields apart. This means that the game can be efficiently traversed, if the players only throw 4s.

## Implementation in Python and Tkinter

The game is implemented in Python and Tkinter. Tkinter provides an event loop into which all actions of the game need to be inserted.


## Features

* Stones can be selected by clicking and placed by clicking on an allowed square
* Upon selecting a stone, the available moves are shown on the board
* The game's state is displayed in the status bar ("Black's turn", "Not possible to move there")
* It is possible to select any stone from the pile of unused stones, not only the first one
* The computer's move is delayed by half a second to make the moves more accesible to the user
* Freed stones are displayed in a golden color
* The game's language (interface) can be changed through a preference menu. The available languages so far are English (default), German and Russian. Support for Spanish, French and Esperanto is planned. The strings are stored in a separate file and are imported at the beginning of the program
* The game's language can be changed during the game without affecting the game state
* The winner is displayed as a popup (alert) window
* The game can be restarted and exited with a menu option

## Issues and Future Tasks

* Sometimes there seems to appear an error, where it is not allowed to make any more moves, even though there are possible ones left
* It is not possible to skip a move, if there are no possible moves left (for example all stones are blocked)
* Sometimes it happens that the other player is skipped several times in a row. This might be due to the fact that they throw a 0 each time
* The ruleset should be allowed to be changed (different paths, different meanings of the special fields)
* The colors and general theme could be allowed to be changed
* The game window can be resized, but the canvas itself does not adapt to the window size. This could be made relative to account for resized windows
* The language does not update immediately, but only after the first move
* An icon should be added to be displayed in the taskbar/dock
* The game should be packaged to be used even without a Python installation (exe/dmg)
